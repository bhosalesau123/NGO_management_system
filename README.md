Ngo_Management_System

NGOs or Non-Governmental Organization is an organization that operates 
independently of any organization. NGOs are typically non-profit organisations 
and many of them are funded by donations from members, private institutions, 
general public etc.  
Maintaining transparency with respect to how the donations are spent greatly 
increases the confidence of donors and also improves the credibility of an NGO. 
Thereby, helping to improve their reach in the long term. 
Using conventional paper-based methods for managing the funds of an NGO 
increases the risk for embezzlement and fraud.
